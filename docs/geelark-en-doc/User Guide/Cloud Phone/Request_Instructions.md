- `traceId`: Use `Version 4 UUID`
- `Authorization` Set to `Bearer <The token value obtained from the client>`

Response Instructions

### Key verification

#### Required Request Headers for Verification

* `appId`: Team AppId
* `traceId`: Unique request ID
* `ts`: Timestamp in milliseconds
* `nonce`: Random number
* `sign`: Signature result

#### Verification Parameter Generation Method

* `traceId`: Use `Version 4 UUID`
* `nonce`: Use the first 6 characters of `traceId`
* `sign`: Concatenate the string `TeamAppId` + `traceId` + `ts` + `nonce` + `TeamApiKey`, then generate the `SHA256` hexadecimal uppercase digest of the string.

#### Example of Required Request Headers for Verification

Assuming the team's ApiKey is `YjmFIUuq0oJgSDJ42fxLEb6R1qjjqf`, the request headers would be set as follows:

* `appId`: `eH6gQR4oHr3FsZpI36La01IW`
* `traceId`: `db6094ab-3797-4186-84d5-b0b58eebad56`
* `ts`: `1716972892166`
* `nonce`: `db6094`
* `sign`: `6280C080AF7C3CCE168F15C913E3444A00A618CB0E16038EED9811D6E3366BDD`

---------------------

When the response code is `200`, the response body will be in `JSON` format.

### Response Object Fields
